        <p style={{textAlign: 'left', lineHeight: 2.0}}>
          Brian is the developer behind Spotted Parking. From design architecture and tech stack
          to publishing the app to IOS and Android. He has been working on this project consistenly and 
          is dedicating his work to make sure user's time is being spent efficiently. Brian lives in 
          Austin and has experienced first hand the lack of information when it comes to parking and 
          available spots. Not only does he want to help users, he also wants to hold them accountable. 
          With this app government workers will be able to give out tickets to parking violators quicker and 
          more consistently. He hopes you enjoy the app and will take user feedback, always.
